								<p>I'm a third-year student at Queen's University, Canada, graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science in May 2024. 
                                I live in Toronto and hope to stay and work here after graduation as well. I'm working my skillset towards full-stack development, 
                                and I have a huge interest in the XR (Extended Reality) industry.
                                I'm always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and my ultimate goal is to become a full-stack XR developer and create 
                                innovative applications that improve the world we live in. </p>

                                <p>In my free time, I enjoy a ton of non tech-related activities.</p>
                                <p>Music is a central part of my life, and I have been playing the guitar since I was ten. I love the creative outlet that it provides, and I'm always looking for opportunities to perform. 
                                <br>Motorsports are a thrilling activity that encompasses a love of speed and technology. I currently head the car club at my school - the Queen's Automotive Society. We host events such as car meets, 
                                track days, and cruises for students and locals. It's a great way for me to connect with others with common interests, and seeing the turnouts at my events is an amazing feeling. There's nothing more 
                                satisying than setting a new lap record after countless months of tuning my cars, and rush of adrenaline that comes with being behind the wheel is like none other.
                                <br>Fencing is a sport that I have been doing since my freshman year of high school. I love the challenge of competition and the physical and mental demands of the sport. 
                                I fence epee on the Queen's Varsity Fencing Team and am ranked in the top-50 nationally. I am proud to have represented my clubs in various tournaments, and hope to compete on the international level one day.

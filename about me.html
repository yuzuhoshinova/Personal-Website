								<p>I'm a third-year student at Queen's University, Canada, graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science in May 2024. 
                                I live in Toronto and hope to stay and work here after graduation as well. I'm working my skillset towards full-stack development, 
                                and I have a huge interest in the XR (Extended Reality) industry.
                                I'm always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and my ultimate goal is to become a full-stack XR developer and create 
                                innovative applications that improve the world we live in. </p>

                                <p>In my free time, I enjoy a ton of non tech-related activities.</p>
                                <p>Music has always been a central part of my life, and I have been playing the guitar since I was ten. I love the creative outlet that it provides, and I'm always looking for opportunities to perform. 
                                Music production is a hobby that I took up more recently, but it has quickly become one of my favorites. I enjoy the creative process of producing music, from composing and arranging to recording and mixing. 
                                <br>There's nothing more satisying than setting a new lap record after countless months of tuning my car. The rush of adrenaline that comes with being behind the wheel is like none other.
                                From hearing the roar of engines to the skill required to navigate a track, motorsports are a thrilling activity that encompasses a love of speed and technology.
                                I currently head the car club at my school - the Queen's Automotive Society. We host events such as car meets, track days, and cruises for students and locals. It's a great way for me to connect with others with common interests, 
                                and seeing the turnouts at my events is an amazing feeling.
                                <br>Fencing is a sport that I have been doing since my freshman year of high school. I love the challenge of competition and the physical and mental demands of the sport. 
                                I fence Epee on the QueensU Varsity Fencing Team and am ranked in the top-50 nationally. I am proud to have represented my clubs in various tournaments, and hope to compete on the international level one day. 
                                </p>
